# CrossFlowLiquidity Protocol

A cross-chain liquidity aggregation protocol that optimizes capital efficiency across multiple blockchain networks and DEXs. The protocol automatically routes trades through the most efficient paths while maintaining security and minimizing costs.

## Problem Solved

CrossFlowLiquidity addresses three critical DeFi problems:
1. Fragmented liquidity across chains and DEXs
2. High slippage on individual DEXs
3. Complex multi-hop trades requiring manual optimization

## Core Features

- Cross-chain liquidity aggregation
- Automated route optimization
- MEV protection
- Gas cost optimization
- Validator-secured bridges
- Oracle price verification

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- `cross-flow_liquidity-protocol.clar`: Core protocol logic
- `LiquidityPool.clar`: Pool management
- `Bridge.clar`: Cross-chain communication
- `Oracle.clar`: Price feeds
- `Governance.clar`: Protocol governance

### Security Features

- Multi-signature validation
- Slippage protection
- Oracle price verification
- Emergency circuit breakers
- Time-locked governance

## Protocol Parameters

- Protocol Fee: 0.3%
- Minimum Validator Set: 7/10
- Maximum Route Length: 5 hops
- Price Update Frequency: 30 seconds
